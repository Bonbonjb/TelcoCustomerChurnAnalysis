Telco Customer Churn Analysis project using Power BI
# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The analysis, conducted using Power BI, focuses on understanding the demographics and account information of high-risk customers to identify factors contributing to churn. This project is intended to help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:
- Analyze customer churn data to understand key factors associated with churn.
- Visualize churn rates by demographic and account features.
- Provide insights and recommendations to reduce churn.

## Key Insights

Based on the analysis, here are the main insights:

1. **High Churn Among Month-to-Month Contracts**: Customers on a month-to-month contract have a higher churn rate compared to those with longer-term contracts, indicating that month-to-month customers may have less loyalty.
2. **Impact of Internet Service Type**: Customers using fiber optic internet have a higher churn rate, which could point to service quality or pricing issues with this type of connection.
3. **No Add-Ons**: Most churned customers did not subscribe to additional services like online security and tech support, suggesting that bundled services could improve retention.
4. **High-Risk Payment Methods**: Customers using electronic checks show a higher churn rate, which could suggest dissatisfaction with billing methods or payment flexibility.

## KPI Dashboard

The KPI dashboard provides a high-level summary of critical metrics:
- **Total Customers**: 7,043
- **Churned Customers**: 1,869
- **Churn Rate**: 26.5%
- **Annual Revenue**: $16.06M

## Recommendations

- **Encourage Longer Contracts**: Offer incentives for customers on month-to-month contracts to switch to longer-term plans to increase loyalty.
- **Improve Fiber Optic Service**: Investigate issues related to fiber optic service quality and pricing to address the higher churn rate among these customers.
- **Promote Add-On Services**: Encourage customers to subscribe to additional services like online security and tech support, as these features are associated with lower churn.
- **Reevaluate Payment Methods**: Provide more payment options or incentives for high-risk payment methods (e.g., electronic checks) to address potential billing issues.
